== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to generate images ? =

There are several ways :
<ul>
<li>You can generate an image with the button "Click to generate" on a post (works on Gutemberg & Classic Editor).</li>
<li>You can mass generate thumbnails for posts. Go into the list of your posts, choose posts or taxonomy you want to get thumbnails, and into “Bulk Actions” choose “Generate featured images”</li>
<li>You can also automatically schedule generation with crons, or by enabling compatibility with REST Requests, WPeMatico, FeedWordPress & WP Automatic Plugin.</li>
</ul>

= Is it unlimited ? =

Yes you can generate image as much as you want.

= Why images aren't generated anymore ? =

If you use Google Image too much for generation in a short time, your server may be temporarily banned. In this case, you should enable Interval for the generation.

= I have other pre-sale questions, can you help? =
